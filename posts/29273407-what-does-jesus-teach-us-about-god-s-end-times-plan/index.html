What does Jesus teach us about the end-times? He teaches us about God’s End-Times Plan, which can be summarized in a sentence – Jesus is the goal of God’s End-Times Plan.\nIn this study, we will be looking at the book of Revelation, which John was told to write by Jesus (Revelation 1:1) shortly before the death of the last Roman Emperor, Domitian.\nReadings Please read Matthew 24:29-31 and Revelation 1:8-9, 4:2, 5:6, and 20:10 before we begin this study.\nRevelation 1:8-9 I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.\nI, John, your brother who share with you in Jesus the persecution and kingdom and patient endurance, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.\nRevelation 4:2\nImmediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and One sitting on the throne.\nRevelation 5:6\nAnd I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as though slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth.\nRevelation 20:10\nThe devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\nReview What does Jesus teach us about God’s End-Times Plan? He teaches us that Jesus is the goal of God’s End-Times Plan. When John was writing the book of Revelation, which is a record of visions that he was given to write by Jesus, (Revelation 1:1) John was told to write,\nI, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star. (Revelation 22:16 NIV)\nThe angel then told John,\nThe Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let him who hears say, “Come!” Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life. (Revelation 22:17 NIV)\nThe last words of the book of Revelation are important to consider when we are determining what Jesus teaches us about the end-times. Jesus teaches us that the water of life is for whosoever is thirsty. Therefore, Jesus is teaching us that the end-times are important for believers, but they aren’t for non-believers. They are for those who are thirsty, and want to take part in God’s End-Times Plan by obeying Jesus.\nWe also notice that Jesus calls himself the Root and the Offspring of David. This is very important because it tells us exactly who Jesus is. Jesus is the root and the offspring of David. That means that Jesus is both Jewish and Gentile – the Root of Jewishness and the Offspring of Gentileness.\nThroughout the book of Revelation, John recorded a series of visions which were given to him by Jesus. They weren’t given to him because Jesus wanted him to learn things about the future, but because he knew that others needed to learn what Jesus showed him.\nIn John’s first vision that Jesus gave him, Jesus told him that Revelation 1:8-9 says.\nI am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. (Revelation 1:8 NIV)\nWhen Jesus said,\nI am the Alpha and the Omega, (Revelation 1:8a NIV)\nHe revealed himself as the one who created time itself. Before Jesus created time, and we all had the chance to experience and enjoy time with him, time didn’t exist. Jesus created time for our benefit. So, Jesus existed before any of us did, and we all existed in time. We all exist in time still.\nJesus is telling us in Revelation 1:8a that he is the one who created the past, and present, and the future. So, every prophecy, including the ones given in the book of Revelation, are subject to Jesus, not to Satan.\nThe question,\nWho is and who was and who is to come, (Revelation 1:8b NIV)\nIs answered by Revelation 5:6. John writes,\nI saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as though slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth. (Revelation 5:6 NIV)\nRevelation 5:6 describes Jesus as the Lamb standing as though slain. He’s standing as though slain because he actually died on the cross for us. This isn’t just something that Jesus did way back then in the past. He’s not dead. He’s alive, but he’s standing as though slain, because he actually died on the cross for us. His detah is relevant to the present, but it’s also relevant to the future.\nHe has seven eyes, which means that he sees everything. He’s omniscient. He knows everything and He is everywhere at once. He has seven horns, which means that he is very powerful – he is omnipotent. Revelation 5:6 reveals that Jesus is the one who holds all things together. He’s the creator and sustainer of the universe. So, he is eternal – he is to come.\nConclusion The book of Revelation reveals that Jesus is the goal of God’s End-Times Plan. In this study we’ve seen that Jesus is the creator, who was before our creation, and the sustainer, who holds everything together. Jesus is the goal of God’s End Times Plan because he is the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent creator of all things, which means that no one, not even Satan can stop Jesus from coming. Jesus is coming, and he’s going to make everything right again.\nHave you already taken part in God’s End-Times Plan by obeying Jesus?\nYou might also enjoy In this episode, we conclude the series on God’s End-Times Plan and discuss how we can live the Christian life to completion.\nWe usually think of God’s End-Times Plan in the future. In this study, we will see that the events of God’s End-Times Plan are happening now – in the present.\nHave you ever wondered why we tend to see so much suffering in the world? We can get some insight into God’s plan by looking at the prophet Daniel.\nHow do we escape from the evil one, the devil? We can do so by obeying Jesus. In this study, we will discuss how Jesus tells us how to escape from the evil one.\n","wordCount":"1110","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-06T12:34:40Z","dateModified":"2024-03-06T12:34:40Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://vaceslavkanukov3.github.io/posts/29273407-what-does-jesus-teach-us-about-god-s-end-times-plan/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vaceslav Kanukov","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://vaceslavkanukov3.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://vaceslavkanukov3.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Vaceslav Kanukov (Alt + H)">Vaceslav Kanukov</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What Does Jesus Teach Us about God's End-Times Plan?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-06 12:34:40 +0000 UTC'>March 6, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label=Readings>Readings</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Revelation 1:8-9">Revelation 1:8-9</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Review>Review</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="You might also enjoy">You might also enjoy</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Many people are confused by what the Bible teaches about the end-times.
