Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. (Colossians 3:1-2)\nWe are to love each other and do good to one another, without fail Let us be sympathetic, feeling for and showing concern for our fellow believers, to make their burdens our own and to share them. (v.13)\nLet us do good to all people, and especially to those who belong to the family of believers. (Galatians 6:10)\nContinue to remember those who are in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering. (Hebrews 13:3)\nWhoever does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. (1 Timothy 5:8)\nWe are to forgive each other, and do it quickly Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. (Colossians 3:13)\nTherefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift. (Matthew 5:23-24)\nBe kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. (Ephesians 4:32)\nWe must not allow anger or pride to harm us My brothers and sisters, be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. (James 1:19-20)\nHe was despised and rejected—a man of suffering—and as one from whom people hide their faces. He was despised, and we did not value him. (Isaiah 53:3)\nWe must be attentive to each other’s needs Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. (Galatians 6:2)\nWe must help each other develop in character and spiritual maturity And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. (Hebrews 10:24)\nYou have instructed me and given me insight, and I have lived according to your teaching, and have done so even in the great hostility I faced. (Psalm 119:73-74)\nAppoint elders in every town; anyone respected and attested by the people, and who also has a good reputation with the outsiders. (Acts 15:22)\nWe must encourage each other, and we must not despise or disparage each other’s gifts Appoint elders in every town; anyone respected and attested by the people, and who also has a good reputation with the outsiders. (Acts 15:22)\nDo everything without complaining and arguing. (Philippians 2:14)\nSo I will judge each of you with justice and redeem you to a pure people. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and grant you a heart of flesh. (Ezekiel 11:19)\nNow if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, each builder’s work will be plainly seen, for the Day will make it clear, because it will be revealed by fire. The fire will test each person’s work, of what sort it is. (1 Corinthians 3:12-13)\nWe must show respect for each other’s spiritual leaders, and obey them, as they are appointed by God And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helpfulness, administration, and various kinds of tongues. (1 Corinthians 12:28)\nBe subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. (1 Peter 2:13-14)\nWe must work well with each other, building each other up Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. Avoid godless chatter, because those trained in the basics of the faith (children belonging to God) should be able to refute those who oppose it. (Titus 2:15-2:18)\nExamine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? (2 Corinthians 13:5)\nAll of you, be like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. (Philippians 2:2-4)\nDon’t be selfish; don’t try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves. Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too. (Philippians 2:3-4 NLT)\nIn the same way, be joyful. Pray continually. (1 Thessalonians 5:16-17)\nBrothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them. (Acts 6:3)\nWe must help each other when we are weak Because he himself was weak and powerless, he doesn’t come to help with his own power, but with ours. (Hebrews 2:18)\nCarry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. (Galatians 6:2)\nIt’s hard to give a massage to a strong man. But a sick man doesn’t mind being massaged; he likes it. You are like that. You are like sick people who understand that you need a doctor. (James 5:14-15 GW)\nBrothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted. (Galatians 6:1)\nWe must give each other grace May the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. (1 Peter 5:10)\nSo now that we’ve gotten past that point and you’ve made it safely through the essentials, we want you to be moved to mature love; we want you to put your whole effort into getting to know God and Jesus Christ, who came to you to bring you that knowledge. (1 Peter 1:13-14 MSG)\nIn all that you say to one another, be gracious. (1 Peter 3:7)\nThen we, who are many, will be like one, because there is one bread that gives us to eat, one body, one cup in which we all share. (1 Corinthians 10:17)\nWe must have patience with each other Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. (John 13:17)\nLet us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. (Galatians 6:9-10)\nMy brothers and sisters, be patient until the Lord’s return. Consider the farmers who patiently wait for the precious crop from the ground. They patiently wait for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient; stand firm; pray.
