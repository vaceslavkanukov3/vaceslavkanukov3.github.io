We have the chance right now to put our lives in order, to get this priority right with Him. What will be important on the Day of Judgment? What will we really want and desire when we arrive in heaven? Jesus' followers have an opportunity that most people never know or experience. As you read on, you will see that God has given us a strong commitment to study and pray about these ideas.\nWhy Should We Read Jesus' Words in the Sermon on the Mount? These words from Jesus are very important, because he said that they are meant to help us understand how to have a good and meaningful life. Jesus did not just speak to his fellow Jews. He said the same things to the people of many nations: \"When he [Jesus] sat down, the crowds gathered around him, and he began to teach. As he sat teaching, the Pharisees and Teachers of the Law came to him. They were looking for a reason to accuse him. They asked him, 'Pharisees and Teachers of the Law, testify if what we are doing is wrong.' He asked them, 'Who is it that says that the law is wrong?' 'It is us,' they replied. He said, 'It's your job to teach and explain it. You are well trained in the Jewish laws, and the scripture cannot be broken. But I tell you that not one letter in any part of the law will pass away until everything is done (Matthew 12:1-6).\nWe can consider everything Jesus said on the subject. After they said and did so many evil things, then what did he say? He said that he was going to explain something. He was going to teach in such a way that we could understand:\n*the will of God (Matt. 7:21; Luke 6:46)\nthe pure and precious lives we would live (Matt. 5:8)\nthe beautiful human virtues we could have in heaven when we die (Matt. 5:20)\nhow we will be rewarded in heaven (Matt. 5:6)\nHe is the Lord who spoke and said: \"Do not judge by appearances! But judge rightly. How awful it will be for those who accuse other people and judge. They judge rightly, but do evil in their own lives! You know, it will be like being judged by the same standard they used. Just as you condemn others, you will be condemned and what you are and you do will be judged. How awful it will be for those who insult other people and call them 'brood of snakes!' You will be punished like that. How awful it will be for those who tell people to do things that do not follow their own teaching. You will be punished like that. How awful it will be for those who accuse and make others untrustworthy (Luke 6:37-39). This is exactly the same message as Jesus gave in Matthew 5:20, because evil lives will not last. You see, Jesus is the God who wants all things in his great kingdom of heaven to be perfect and beautiful. \"Unless your righteousness is greater than that of the teachers of the law and the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. The Pharisees and the Teachers of the law do nothing that looks good to people, but they ignore the commands of God. Because they go around and make others obey the smallest commands in the law. But they pay no attention to the thing that is important to God. The Lord says, 'You people who follow the law and teachers of the law! You blind and foolish leaders! You twist God's words. You place heavy burdens on people, but you yourself refuse to lift a finger to help them. Why do you do this? (Matthew 23:23-24). In the end he said these words to warn us: 'Everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord!' will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Only those who follow the commands of my Father in heaven will enter the kingdom of God. Many people will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord!' didn't we prophesy in your name? Didn't we drive out demons in your name? And didn't we do many wonderful miracles in your name? But I will say to them, \"I never knew you. Get away from me, you evildoers!\" (Matthew 7:21-23).\nHow Can We Know That Jesus Was The Son of God? There is very clear evidence that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, the only God who could ever save anyone. John, a close friend of Jesus, told us about the miracles and proofs of Jesus in his writings: \"The man named Jesus of Nazareth was born a Jew. He did so many miracles and God's Spirit often spoke from him. People always wondered when they saw him, he was sent from God. John said, 'The man who has the truth comes from God (John 3:33-34). In the book of Acts, many people wrote about all the wonderful miraculous signs Jesus performed. I have known some people who deny that Jesus was the Son of God. But most people who believe that the Bible is the true word of God have had some amazing experiences. They have met God and talked with him. They feel that he is with them when they need him. Why do I still believe that Jesus is the Son of God? One day, the Spirit of God gave me some very strong feelings that the Holy Bible is true. The people who wrote the Bible are also my friends. And I have had some very strong and powerful experiences of Jesus, my wonderful Redeemer, my God in heaven. And I also see in the New Testament where Jesus said that he is the only One who knows God the Father.\nDo Christians Need to Follow a Lot of Rules When They Make Decisions? Many rules and decisions have been made by men. Many of them have different ideas from you, your teachers, and the people you look up to. How do we know which ones to follow? The Bible is the best answer to that question. It is written by God, and it is about the way he lives. The Bible is the only way we can understand the character and qualities of God, so we know which rules to follow. The Bible has amazing wisdom and power to make sure that you have a better life and a better eternity. Does anyone else tell you what you should and should not do in life? Their advice may seem important, but do you follow it? You don't want to give people false hope about what they are doing, if they do not follow all the instructions in the Bible. It is bad for the world when we act in wrong ways and deceive others. God wants us to be happy and healthy as we live, and to be with him forever in heaven. There are so many bad things in the world that we need to avoid. But there are also so many amazing and joyful things to do that we have not done, if we are not in the world.\nWhat Should You Do to Build Your Life on a Sure Foundation? Jesus said, \"Everyone who hears and obeys my words is like a wise person. Who builds his house on good rock. But everyone who does not listen to my words or does not follow and obey them is like a foolish person. He builds his house on weak sand (Matthew 7:24-25).\nWho Should We Follow and Obey? Jesus said, \"Whoever follows and obeys my Father in heaven does the will of my Father who is in heaven. I tell you that unless you do these things and obey my Father, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 7:21-22).\nDoes the Bible Give Advice about How to Make Decisions? Jesus said, \"Do not judge others by what you do or do not like. But if you judge them, then you are not good enough to have any power in the kingdom of heaven. You cannot have it. If you judge others, the way you will be judged yourself. If you love others, then you will receive their love. If you are kind, then you will receive kindness. If you are honest, then you will receive honesty. And you will receive as much as you give to others (Matthew 7:1-2).\nShould We Think about How Our Actions Will Affect People Who are Not God's People? Jesus said, \"Do not think that what you eat will hurt your body or help it. What really happens is that it goes into your stomach. Then the food goes into your intestines and it comes out in the toilet like it was before. But it does not help or hurt you. Everything that\n","wordCount":"1524","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-07T18:21:57Z","dateModified":"2024-03-07T18:21:57Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://vaceslavkanukov3.github.io/posts/81355328-why-should-christians-evaluate-what-their-lives-are-built-on/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vaceslav Kanukov","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://vaceslavkanukov3.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://vaceslavkanukov3.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Vaceslav Kanukov (Alt + H)">Vaceslav Kanukov</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Should Christians Evaluate What Their Lives Are Built On?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-07 18:21:57 +0000 UTC'>March 7, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Why Should We Read Jesus' Words in the Sermon on the Mount?">Why Should We Read Jesus' Words in the Sermon on the Mount?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="How Can We Know That Jesus Was The Son of God?">How Can We Know That Jesus Was The Son of God?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Do Christians Need to Follow a Lot of Rules When They Make Decisions?">Do Christians Need to Follow a Lot of Rules When They Make Decisions?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="What Should You Do to Build Your Life on a Sure Foundation?">What Should You Do to Build Your Life on a Sure Foundation?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Who Should We Follow and Obey?">Who Should We Follow and Obey?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Does the Bible Give Advice about How to Make Decisions?">Does the Bible Give Advice about How to Make Decisions?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Should We Think about How Our Actions Will Affect People Who are Not God's People?">Should We Think about How Our Actions Will Affect People Who are Not God's People?</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Why should Christians evaluate what their lives are built on?
